            Project Sentry
In March 1947, Project Sentry kicks off at the West Virginia installation known only as the Facility, 
when a joint United States/Canadian government operation employs former Nazi scientists and material from Canada’s Weapon X Program in an effort not only to re-create the USA's Super Soldier Serum, which empowered Steve Rogers, AKA Captain America, nearly a decade before, but also to magnify its effects on an ideal test subject by several thousandfold. However, Cold War politics eventually interfere with the project, fragmenting it into sub-operations with outsourced research and no central administration guiding it in its entirety, and no subsequent super-soldier projects, such as those that produced the Nightmericans, Ted Sallis, AKA the Man-Thing, Frank Simpson, AKA Nuke, and others, met with total success.
Decades following Project Sentry’s beginnings, Robert Reynolds, a high school freshman suffering from schizophrenia and anxiety disorder, steals an experimental version of the Super-Soldier Serum from one of his science professors, a subcontracted researcher with the project. Unaware of its nature and hoping for no more than a memorable drug experience, Reynolds drinks the serum and immediately obtains remarkable solar-powered superhuman abilities. Due to his psychiatric problems, Reynolds manifests an intensely malevolent persona called the Void, but his subconscious just as quickly manifests a balancing heroic persona. Unconsciously separating into two entities, neither aware of their connection to the other, Reynolds, unable to manage the Void identity as yet, takes the form of the Blue Buffoon, a costumed criminal based on childhood drawings. He threatens his classmate and crush Lindy Lee. The heroic persona, wearing a makeshift mask, defeats the Buffoon and departs.
